          Two-day event to include discussions among USPTO leadership and
          experts from industry, academia, and the public <br /><br />Jul 14,
          2015

        <p>
          Inventors are encouraged to search the USPTO's patent database to see
          if a patent has already been filed or granted that is similar to your
          patent. Patents may be searched in the USPTO Patent Full-Text and
          Image Database (PatFT). The USPTO houses full text for patents issued
          from 1976 to the present and PDF images for all patents from 1790 to
          the present.
          <br /><br />All sequences (SEQ ID NOs.) and tables for listed patents
          or publications are available for viewing, without downloading, by
          accessing the proper document detail page and then submitting a SEQ ID
          NO or a mega table ID number.
        </p>

        <h2>Global Patent Search Network (GPSN)</h2>
        <p>
          Global Patent Search Network (GPSN) enables users to search the full
          text of multiple international patent collections. The initial
          collection available will be Chinese patent documentation from the
          State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of the People's Republic of
          China. Users can search published applications, granted patents and
          utility models from 1985 to 2012. The data available includes full
          text Chinese patents, English machine translations and full document
          images. This collection will be periodically updated to include
          additional years of coverage.

          information regarding patent application status.

          To make it easier for any inventor to pursue patent protection in both
          the U.S. and Australia, USPTO Deputy Director Michelle K. Lee (right)
          and IP Australia Director General Patricia Kelly (left) signed
          Wednesday a Memorandum of Understanding strengthening their already
          solid partnership.
